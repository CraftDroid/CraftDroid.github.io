### ReCBench
ReCBench is a collection of 200 Android crashed apps (where you must download from [AndroZoo](https://androzoo.uni.lu) with the sha256 provided for each apk) with crash reproducing script and crash message filtered out from LogCat.
The dataset is accessible [here](https://github.com/CraftDroid/ReCBench).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/CraftDroid/CraftDroid.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
